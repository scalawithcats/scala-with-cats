## Traverse {#sec:traverse}

`foldLeft` and `foldRight` are flexible iteration methods
but they require us to do a lot of work
to define accumulators and combinator functions.
The `Traverse` type class is a higher level tool
that leverages `Applicatives` to provide
a more convenient, more lawful, pattern for iteration.

### Traversing with Futures

We can demonstrate `Traverse` using
the `Future.traverse` and `Future.sequence` methods in the Scala standard library.
These methods provide `Future`-specific implementations of the traverse pattern.
As an example, suppose we have a list of server hostnames
and a method to poll a host for its uptime:

```tut:book:silent
import scala.concurrent._
import scala.concurrent.duration._
import scala.concurrent.ExecutionContext.Implicits.global

val hostnames = List(
  "alpha.example.com",
  "beta.example.com",
  "gamma.demo.com"
)

def getUptime(hostname: String): Future[Int] =
  Future(hostname.length * 60) // just for demonstration
```

Now, suppose we want to poll all of the hosts and collect all of their uptimes.
We can't simply `map` over `hostnames`
because the result---a `List[Future[Int]]`---would
contain more than one `Future`.
We need to reduce the results to a single `Future`
to get something we can block on.
Let's start by doing this manually using a fold:

```tut:book:silent
val allUptimes: Future[List[Int]] =
  hostnames.foldLeft(Future(List.empty[Int])) {
    (accum, host) =>
      val uptime = getUptime(host)
      for {
        accum  <- accum
        uptime <- uptime
      } yield accum :+ uptime
  }
```

```tut:book
Await.result(allUptimes, 1.second)
```

Intuitively, we iterate over `hostnames`, call `func` for each item,
and combine the results into a list.
This sounds simple, but the code is fairly unwieldy
because of the need to create and combine `Futures` at every iteration.
We can improve on things greatly using `Future.traverse`,
which is tailor-made for this pattern:

```tut:book:silent
val allUptimes: Future[List[Int]] =
  Future.traverse(hostnames)(getUptime)
```

```tut:book
Await.result(allUptimes, 1.second)
```

This is much clearer and more concise---let's see how it works.
If we ignore distractions like `CanBuildFrom` and `ExecutionContext`,
the implementation of `Future.traverse` in the standard library looks like this:

```scala
def traverse[A, B](values: List[A])
    (func: A => Future[B]): Future[List[B]] =
  values.foldLeft(Future(List.empty[A])) { (accum, host) =>
    val item = func(host)
    for {
      accum <- accum
      item  <- item
    } yield accum :+ item
  }
```

This is essentially the same as our example code above.
`Future.traverse` is abstracting away the pain of folding
and defining accumulators and combination functions.
It gives us a clean high-level interface to do what we want:

- start with a `List[A]`;
- provide a function `A => Future[B]`;
- end up with a `Future[List[B]]`.

The standard library also provides another method, `Future.sequence`,
that assumes we're starting with a `List[Future[B]]`
and don't need to provide an identity function:

```scala
object Future {
  def sequence[B](futures: List[Future[B]]): Future[List[B]] =
    traverse(futures)(identity)

  // etc...
}
```

In this case the intuitive understanding is even simpler:

- start with a `List[Future[A]]`;
- end up with a `Future[List[A]]`.

`Future.traverse` and `Future.sequence`
solve a very specific problem:
they allow us to iterate over a sequence of `Futures`
and accumulate a result.
The simplified examples above only work with `Lists`,
but the real `Future.traverse` and `Future.sequence`
work with any standard Scala collection.

Cats' `Traverse` type class generalises these patterns
to work with any type of `Applicative`:
`Future`, `Option`, `Validated`, and so on.
We'll approach `Traverse` in the next sections in two steps:
first we'll generalise over the `Applicative`,
then we'll generalise over the sequence type.
We'll end up with an extremely valuable tool that trivialises
many operations involving sequences and other data types.

### Traversing with Applicatives

If we squint, we'll see that we can rewrite `traverse`
in terms of an `Applicative`.
Our accumulator from the example above:

```tut:book:silent
Future(List.empty[Int])
```

is equivalent to `Applicative.pure`:

```tut:book:silent
import cats.Applicative
import cats.instances.future._
import cats.syntax.applicative._

List.empty[Int].pure[Future]
```

Our combinator, which used to be this:

```tut:book:silent
def oldCombine(
  accum : Future[List[Int]],
  host  : String
): Future[List[Int]] = {
  val uptime = getUptime(host)
  for {
    accum  <- accum
    uptime <- uptime
  } yield accum :+ uptime
}
```

is now equivalent to `Semigroupal.combine`:

```tut:book:silent
import cats.syntax.apply._

// Combining accumulator and hostname using an Applicative:
def newCombine(
  accum: Future[List[Int]],
  host: String
): Future[List[Int]] =
  (accum, getUptime(host)).mapN(_ :+ _)
```

By substituting these snippets back into the definition of `traverse`
we can generalise it to to work with any `Applicative`:

```tut:book:silent
import scala.language.higherKinds

def listTraverse[F[_]: Applicative, A, B]
    (list: List[A])(func: A => F[B]): F[List[B]] =
  list.foldLeft(List.empty[B].pure[F]) { (accum, item) =>
    (accum, func(item)).mapN(_ :+ _)
  }

def listSequence[F[_]: Applicative, B]
    (list: List[F[B]]): F[List[B]] =
  listTraverse(list)(identity)
```

We can use this new `listTraverse` to re-implement our uptime example:

```tut:book
Await.result(
  listTraverse(hostnames)(getUptime),
  1.second
)
```

or we can use it with with other `Applicative` data types
as shown in the following exercises.

#### Exercise: Traversing with Vectors

What is the result of the following?

```tut:book:silent
import cats.instances.vector._

listSequence(List(Vector(1, 2), Vector(3, 4)))
```

<div class="solution">
The argument is of type `List[Vector[Int]]`,
so we're using the `Applicative` for `Vector`
and the return type is going to be `Vector[List[Int]]`.

`Vector` is a monad,
so its semigroupal `combine` function is based on `flatMap`.
We'll end up with a `Vector` of `Lists`
of all the possible combinations of `List(1, 2)` and `List(3, 4)`:

```tut:book
listSequence(List(Vector(1, 2), Vector(3, 4)))
```
</div>

What about a list of three parameters?

```tut:book:silent
listSequence(List(Vector(1, 2), Vector(3, 4), Vector(5, 6)))
```

<div class="solution">
With three items in the input list, we end up with combinations of three `Ints`:
one from the first item, one from the second, and one from the third:

```tut:book
listSequence(List(Vector(1, 2), Vector(3, 4), Vector(5, 6)))
```
</div>

#### Exercise: Traversing with Options

Here's an example that uses `Options`:

```tut:book:silent
import cats.instances.option._

def process(inputs: List[Int]) =
  listTraverse(inputs)(n => if(n % 2 == 0) Some(n) else None)
```

What is the return type of this method? What does it produce for the following inputs?

```tut:book:silent
process(List(2, 4, 6))
process(List(1, 2, 3))
```

<div class="solution">
The arguments to `listTraverse` are of types `List[Int]` and `Int => Option[Int]`,
so the return type is `Option[List[Int]]`.
Again, `Option` is a monad,
so the semigroupal `combine` function follows from `flatMap`.
The semantics are therefore fail-fast error handling:
if all inputs are even, we get a list of outputs.
Otherwise we get `None`:

```tut:book
process(List(2, 4, 6))
process(List(1, 2, 3))
```
</div>

#### Exercise: Traversing with Validated

Finally, here is an example that uses `Validated`:

```tut:book:silent
import cats.data.Validated
import cats.instances.list._ // for Monoid[List]

type ErrorsOr[A] = Validated[List[String], A]

def process(inputs: List[Int]): ErrorsOr[List[Int]] =
  listTraverse(inputs) { n =>
    if(n % 2 == 0) {
      Validated.valid(n)
    } else {
      Validated.invalid(List(s"$n is not even"))
    }
  }
```

What does this method produce for the following inputs?

```tut:book:silent
process(List(2, 4, 6))
process(List(1, 2, 3))
```

<div class="solution">
The return type here is `ErrorsOr[List[Int]]`,
which expands to `Validated[List[String], List[Int]]`.
The semantics for semigroupal `combine` on validated are accumulating error handling,
so the result is either a list of even `Ints`,
or a list of errors detailing which `Ints` failed the test:

```tut:book
process(List(2, 4, 6))
process(List(1, 2, 3))
```
</div>
