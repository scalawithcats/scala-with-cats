There are two major things missing from this version of the book:

1.  We need a summary chapter.
    This will include a condensed discussion of
    everything we have covered in the book together with
    some closing thoughts on application structure
    and service oriented architecture.

2.  Second, we need to weave the exercises from
    the Essential Play training course through the text of the book.
    We currently have a complete set of exercises for Chapter 2,
    but the remaining content chapters need fleshing out with their own exercises.
