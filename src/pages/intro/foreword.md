# Foreword {-}

The aims of this book are two-fold: 
to introduce monads, functors, and other functional programming patterns 
as a way to structure program design, 
and to explain how these concepts are implemented in [Cats][cats].

Monads, and related concepts, are the functional programming equivalent 
of object-oriented design patterns---architectural building blocks 
that turn up over and over again in code. 
They differ from object-oriented patterns in two main ways:

- they are formally, and thus precisely, defined; and
- they are extremely (extremely) general.

This generality means they can be difficult to understand; 
everyone find abstraction difficult. 
However, it is generality that allows concepts like monads 
to be applied in such a wide variety of situations. 

In this book we aim to show the concepts in a number of different ways, 
to help you build a mental model 
of how they work and where they are appropriate. 
We have extended case studies, a simple graphical notation, 
many smaller examples, and of course the mathematical definitions. 
Between them we hope you'll find something that works for you.

Ok, let's get started!
