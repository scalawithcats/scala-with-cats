## Kleislis

We'll finish off this case study
by cleaning up the implementation of `Check`.
A justifiable criticism of our approach
is that we've written a lot of code to do very little.
A `Predicate` is essentially a function `A => Validated[E, A]`,
and a `Check` is basically a wrapper
that lets us compose these functions.

We can abstract `A => Validated[E, A]` to `A => F[B]`,
which you'll recognise as the type of function
you pass to the `flatMap` method on a monad.
Imagine we have the following sequence of operations:

- We lift some value into a monad (by using `pure`, for example).
  This is a function with type `A => F[A]`.

- We then sequence some transformations on the monad using `flatMap`.

We can illustrate this as shown in Figure [@fig:validation:kleisli].
We can also write out this example using the monad API as follows:

```scala
val aToB: A => F[B] = ???
val bToC: B => F[C] = ???

def example[A, C](a: A): F[C] =
  aToB(a).flatMap(bToC)
```

![Sequencing monadic transforms](src/pages/case-studies/validation/kleisli.pdf+svg){#fig:validation:kleisli}

Recall that `Check` is, in the abstract,
allowing us to compose functions of type `A => F[B]`.
We can write the above in terms of `andThen` as:

```scala
val aToC = aToB andThen bToC
```

The result is a (wrapped) function `aToC` of type `A => F[C]`
that we can subsequently apply to a value of type `A`.

We have achieved the same thing as the `example` method
without having to reference an argument of type `A`.
The `andThen` method on `Check`
is analogous to function composition,
but is composing function `A => F[B]` instead of `A => B`.

The abstract concept of composing functions
of type `A => F[B]` has a name: a *Kleisli*.

Cats contains a data type [`cats.data.Kleisli`][cats.data.Kleisli]
that wraps a function just as `Check` does.
`Kleisli` has all the methods of `Check` plus some additional ones.
If `Kleisli` seems familiar to you, then congratulations.
You've seen through its disguise and recognised it as another
concept from earlier in the book:
`Kleisli` is just another name for `ReaderT`.

Here is a simple example using `Kleisli`
to transform an integer into a list of integers
through three steps:

```scala mdoc:silent
import cats.data.Kleisli
import cats.instances.list._ // for Monad
```

These steps each transform an input `Int`
into an output of type `List[Int]`:

```scala mdoc:silent
val step1: Kleisli[List, Int, Int] =
  Kleisli(x => List(x + 1, x - 1))

val step2: Kleisli[List, Int, Int] =
  Kleisli(x => List(x, -x))

val step3: Kleisli[List, Int, Int] =
  Kleisli(x => List(x * 2, x / 2))
```

We can combine the steps into a single pipeline
that combines the underlying `Lists` using `flatMap`:

```scala mdoc:silent
val pipeline = step1 andThen step2 andThen step3
```

The result is a function that consumes a single `Int`
and returns eight outputs,
each produced by a different combination
of transformations from `step1`, `step2`, and `step3`:

```scala mdoc
pipeline.run(20)
```

The only notable difference between `Kleisli` and `Check`
in terms of API is that `Kleisli`
renames our `apply` method to `run`.

Let's replace `Check` with `Kleisli` in our validation examples.
To do so we need to make a few changes to `Predicate`.
We must be able to convert a `Predicate` to a function,
as `Kleisli` only works with functions.
Somewhat more subtly,
when we convert a `Predicate` to a function,
it should have type `A => Either[E, A]`
rather than `A => Validated[E, A]`
because `Kleisli` relies on
the wrapped function returning a monad.

Add a method to `Predicate` called `run`
that returns a function of the correct type.
Leave the rest of the code in `Predicate` the same.

<div class="solution">
Here's an abbreviated definition of `run`.
Like `apply`, the method must accept an implicit `Semigroup`:

```scala
import cats.Semigroup
import cats.data.Validated

sealed trait Predicate[E, A] {
  def run(implicit s: Semigroup[E]): A => Either[E, A] =
    (a: A) => this(a).toEither

  def apply(a: A): Validated[E, A] =
    ??? // etc...

  // other methods...
}
```
</div>

Now rewrite our username and email validation example
in terms of `Kleisli` and `Predicate`.
Here are few tips in case you get stuck:

First, remember that the `run` method on `Predicate`
takes an implicit parameter.
If you call `aPredicate.run(a)` it will try
to pass the implicit parameter explicitly.
If you want to create a function from a `Predicate`
and immediately apply that function,
use `aPredicate.run.apply(a)`

Second, type inference can be tricky in this exercise.
We found that the following definitions
helped us to write code with fewer type declarations.

```scala
type Result[A] = Either[Errors, A]

type Check[A, B] = Kleisli[Result, A, B]

// Create a check from a function:
def check[A, B](func: A => Result[B]): Check[A, B] =
  Kleisli(func)

// Create a check from a Predicate:
def checkPred[A](pred: Predicate[Errors, A]): Check[A, A] =
  Kleisli[Result, A, A](pred.run)
```

<div class="solution">
```scala mdoc:invisible:reset-object
// Foreword declarations

import cats.Semigroup
import cats.syntax.apply._     // for mapN
import cats.syntax.semigroup._ // for |+|
import cats.data.Validated
import cats.data.Validated.{Valid, Invalid}

sealed trait Predicate[E, A] {
  import Predicate._

  def and(that: Predicate[E, A]): Predicate[E, A] =
    And(this, that)

  def or(that: Predicate[E, A]): Predicate[E, A] =
    Or(this, that)

  def run(implicit s: Semigroup[E]): A => Either[E, A] =
    (a: A) => this(a).toEither

  def apply(a: A)(implicit s: Semigroup[E]): Validated[E, A] =
    this match {
      case Pure(func) =>
        func(a)

      case And(left, right) =>
        (left(a), right(a)).mapN((_, _) => a)

      case Or(left, right) =>
        left(a) match {
          case Valid(_)   => Valid(a)
          case Invalid(e1) =>
            right(a) match {
              case Valid(_)   => Valid(a)
              case Invalid(e2) => Invalid(e1 |+| e2)
            }
        }
    }
}

object Predicate {
  final case class And[E, A](
    left: Predicate[E, A],
    right: Predicate[E, A]) extends Predicate[E, A]

  final case class Or[E, A](
    left: Predicate[E, A],
    right: Predicate[E, A]) extends Predicate[E, A]

  final case class Pure[E, A](
    func: A => Validated[E, A]) extends Predicate[E, A]

  def apply[E, A](f: A => Validated[E, A]): Predicate[E, A] =
    Pure(f)

  def lift[E, A](error: E, func: A => Boolean): Predicate[E, A] =
    Pure(a => if(func(a)) Valid(a) else Invalid(error))
}
```

Working around limitations of type inference
can be quite frustrating when writing this code,
Working out when to convert between
`Predicates`, functions, and `Validated`, and `Either`
simplifies things, but the process is still complex:

```scala mdoc:silent
import cats.data.{Kleisli, NonEmptyList}
import cats.instances.either._   // for Semigroupal
```

Here is the preamble we suggested in
the main text of the case study:

```scala mdoc:silent
type Errors = NonEmptyList[String]

def error(s: String): NonEmptyList[String] =
  NonEmptyList(s, Nil)

type Result[A] = Either[Errors, A]

type Check[A, B] = Kleisli[Result, A, B]

def check[A, B](func: A => Result[B]): Check[A, B] =
  Kleisli(func)

def checkPred[A](pred: Predicate[Errors, A]): Check[A, A] =
  Kleisli[Result, A, A](pred.run)
```

Our base predicate definitions are
essentially unchanged:

```scala mdoc:silent
def longerThan(n: Int): Predicate[Errors, String] =
  Predicate.lift(
    error(s"Must be longer than $n characters"),
    str => str.size > n)

val alphanumeric: Predicate[Errors, String] =
  Predicate.lift(
    error(s"Must be all alphanumeric characters"),
    str => str.forall(_.isLetterOrDigit))

def contains(char: Char): Predicate[Errors, String] =
  Predicate.lift(
    error(s"Must contain the character $char"),
    str => str.contains(char))

def containsOnce(char: Char): Predicate[Errors, String] =
  Predicate.lift(
    error(s"Must contain the character $char only once"),
    str => str.filter(c => c == char).size == 1)
```

Our username and email examples
are slightly different in that
we make use of `check()` and `checkPred()`
in different situations:

```scala mdoc:silent
val checkUsername: Check[String, String] =
  checkPred(longerThan(3) and alphanumeric)

val splitEmail: Check[String, (String, String)] =
  check(_.split('@') match {
    case Array(name, domain) =>
      Right((name, domain))

    case _ =>
      Left(error("Must contain a single @ character"))
  })

val checkLeft: Check[String, String] =
  checkPred(longerThan(0))

val checkRight: Check[String, String] =
  checkPred(longerThan(2) and contains('.'))

val joinEmail: Check[(String, String), String] =
  check {
    case (l, r) =>
      (checkLeft(l), checkRight(r)).mapN(_ + "@" + _)
  }

val checkEmail: Check[String, String] =
  splitEmail andThen joinEmail
```

Finally, we can see that our `createUser`
example works as expected using `Kleisli`:

```scala mdoc:silent
final case class User(username: String, email: String)

def createUser(
      username: String,
      email: String): Either[Errors, User] = (
  checkUsername.run(username),
  checkEmail.run(email)
).mapN(User)
```

```scala mdoc
createUser("Noel", "noel@underscore.io")
createUser("", "dave@underscore.io@io")
```
</div>

We have now written our code
entirely in terms of `Kleisli` and `Predicate`,
completely removing `Check`.
This is a good first step to simplifying our library.
There's still plenty more to do, but we have a
sophisticated building block from Cats to work with.
We'll leave further improvements up to the reader.
