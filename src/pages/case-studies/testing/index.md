# Case Study: Testing Asynchronous Code {#sec:case-studies:testing}

We'll start with a straightforward case study:
how to simplify unit tests for asynchronous code
by making them synchronous.

Let's return to the example
from Chapter [@sec:foldable-traverse]
where we're measuring the uptime on a set of servers.
We'll flesh out the code into a more complete structure.
There will be two components.
The first is an `UptimeClient`
that polls remote servers for their uptime:

```scala mdoc:silent
import scala.concurrent.Future

trait UptimeClient:
  def getUptime(hostname: String): Future[Int]
```

We'll also have an `UptimeService` that maintains a list of servers
and allows the user to poll them for their total uptime:

```scala mdoc:silent
import cats.instances.future.* // for Applicative
import cats.instances.list.*   // for Traverse
import cats.syntax.traverse.*  // for traverse
import scala.concurrent.ExecutionContext.Implicits.global

class UptimeService(client: UptimeClient):
  def getTotalUptime(hostnames: List[String]): Future[Int] =
    hostnames.traverse(client.getUptime).map(_.sum)
```

We've modelled `UptimeClient` as a trait
because we're going to want to stub it out in unit tests.
For example, we can write a test client
that allows us to provide dummy data
rather than calling out to actual servers:

```scala mdoc:silent
class TestUptimeClient(hosts: Map[String, Int]) extends UptimeClient:
  def getUptime(hostname: String): Future[Int] =
    Future.successful(hosts.getOrElse(hostname, 0))
```

Now, suppose we're writing unit tests for `UptimeService`.
We want to test its ability to sum values,
regardless of where it is getting them from.
Here's an example:

```scala mdoc:fail
def testTotalUptime() = {
  val hosts    = Map("host1" -> 10, "host2" -> 6)
  val client   = new TestUptimeClient(hosts)
  val service  = new UptimeService(client)
  val actual   = service.getTotalUptime(hosts.keys.toList)
  val expected = hosts.values.sum
  assert(actual == expected)
}
```

The code doesn't compile
because we've made a classic error[^warnings].
We forgot that our application code is asynchronous.
Our `actual` result is of type `Future[Int]`
and our `expected` result is of type `Int`.
We can't compare them directly!

[^warnings]: Technically this is a *warning* not an error.
It has been promoted to an error in our case
because we're using the `-Xfatal-warnings` flag on `scalac`.

There are a couple of ways to solve this problem.
We could alter our test code
to accommodate the asynchronousness.
However, there is another alternative.
Let's make our service code synchronous
so our test works without modification!

## Abstracting over Type Constructors

We need to implement two versions of `UptimeClient`:
an asynchronous one for use in production
and a synchronous one for use in our unit tests:

```scala
trait RealUptimeClient extends UptimeClient:
  def getUptime(hostname: String): Future[Int]

trait TestUptimeClient extends UptimeClient:
  def getUptime(hostname: String): Int
```

The question is: what result type should we give
to the abstract method in `UptimeClient`?
We need to abstract over `Future[Int]` and `Int`:

```scala
trait UptimeClient:
  def getUptime(hostname: String): ???
```

At first this may seem difficult.
We want to retain the `Int` part from each type
but "throw away" the `Future` part in the test code.
Fortunately, Cats provides a solution
in terms of the *identity type*, `Id`,
that we discussed way back in Section [@sec:monads:identity].
`Id` allows us to "wrap" types in a type constructor
without changing their meaning:

```scala
package cats

type Id[A] = A
```

`Id` allows us to abstract over the return types in `UptimeClient`.
Implement this now:

- write a trait definition for `UptimeClient`
  that accepts a type constructor `F[_]` as a parameter;

- extend it with two traits,
  `RealUptimeClient` and `TestUptimeClient`,
  that bind `F` to `Future` and `Id` respectively;

- write out the method signature for `getUptime`
  in each case to verify that it compiles.

<div class="solution">
Here's the implementation:

```scala mdoc:reset-object:invisible
import scala.concurrent.Future
```
```scala mdoc:silent
import cats.Id

trait UptimeClient[F[_]]:
  def getUptime(hostname: String): F[Int]

trait RealUptimeClient extends UptimeClient[Future]:
  def getUptime(hostname: String): Future[Int]

trait TestUptimeClient extends UptimeClient[Id]:
  def getUptime(hostname: String): Id[Int]
```

Note that, because `Id[A]` is just a simple alias for `A`,
we don't need to refer to the type in `TestUptimeClient`
as `Id[Int]`---we can simply write `Int` instead:

```scala mdoc:reset-object:invisible
import scala.concurrent.Future
import cats.Id

trait UptimeClient[F[_]]:
  def getUptime(hostname: String): F[Int]

trait RealUptimeClient extends UptimeClient[Future]:
  def getUptime(hostname: String): Future[Int]
```
```scala mdoc:silent
trait TestUptimeClient extends UptimeClient[Id]:
  def getUptime(hostname: String): Int
```

Of course, technically speaking
we don't need to redeclare `getUptime`
in `RealUptimeClient` or `TestUptimeClient`.
However, writing everything out
helps illustrate the technique.
</div>

You should now be able to flesh your definition of `TestUptimeClient`
out into a full class based on a `Map[String, Int]` as before.

<div class="solution">
The final code is similar to
our original implementation of `TestUptimeClient`,
except we no longer need
the call to `Future.successful`:

```scala mdoc:reset-object:invisible
import scala.concurrent.Future
import cats.Id

trait UptimeClient[F[_]]:
  def getUptime(hostname: String): F[Int]

trait RealUptimeClient extends UptimeClient[Future]:
  def getUptime(hostname: String): Future[Int]
```
```scala mdoc:silent
class TestUptimeClient(hosts: Map[String, Int])
  extends UptimeClient[Id]:
  def getUptime(hostname: String): Int =
    hosts.getOrElse(hostname, 0)
```
</div>

## Abstracting over Monads

Let's turn our attention to `UptimeService`.
We need to rewrite it to abstract over
the two types of `UptimeClient`.
We'll do this in two stages:
first we'll rewrite the class and method signatures,
then the method bodies.
Starting with the method signatures:

- comment out the body of `getTotalUptime`
  (replace it with `???` to make everything compile);

- add a type parameter `F[_]` to `UptimeService`
  and pass it on to `UptimeClient`.

<div class="solution">
The code should look like this:

```scala
class UptimeService[F[_]](client: UptimeClient[F]):
  def getTotalUptime(hostnames: List[String]): F[Int] =
    ???
    // hostnames.traverse(client.getUptime).map(_.sum)
```
</div>

Now uncomment the body of `getTotalUptime`.
You should get a compilation error similar to the following:

```scala
// <console>:28: error: could not find implicit value for
//               evidence parameter of type cats.Applicative[F]
//            hostnames.traverse(client.getUptime).map(_.sum)
//                              ^
```

The problem here is that `traverse` only works
on sequences of values that have an `Applicative`.
In our original code we were traversing a `List[Future[Int]]`.
There is an applicative for `Future` so that was fine.
In this version we are traversing a `List[F[Int]]`.
We need to *prove* to the compiler that `F` has an `Applicative`.
Do this by adding an implicit constructor parameter
to `UptimeService`.

<div class="solution">
We can write this as an implicit parameter:

```scala mdoc:invisible:reset-object
import cats.syntax.traverse.*  // for traverse
import cats.instances.list.*

trait UptimeClient[F[_]]:
  def getUptime(hostname: String): F[Int]
```
```scala mdoc:silent
import cats.Applicative
import cats.syntax.functor.* // for map

class UptimeService[F[_]](client: UptimeClient[F])
    (using a: Applicative[F]):

  def getTotalUptime(hostnames: List[String]): F[Int] =
    hostnames.traverse(client.getUptime).map(_.sum)
```

or more tersely as a context bound:

```scala mdoc:reset-object:invisible
import cats.Applicative
import cats.syntax.functor.*
import cats.syntax.traverse.*
import cats.instances.list.*

trait UptimeClient[F[_]]:
  def getUptime(hostname: String): F[Int]
```
```scala mdoc:silent
class UptimeService[F[_]: Applicative]
    (client: UptimeClient[F]):

  def getTotalUptime(hostnames: List[String]): F[Int] =
    hostnames.traverse(client.getUptime).map(_.sum)
```

Note that we need to import `cats.syntax.functor`
as well as `cats.Applicative`.
This is because we're switching from using
`future.map` to the Cats' generic extension method
that requires an implicit `Functor` parameter.
</div>

Finally, let's turn our attention to our unit tests.
Our test code now works
as intended without any modification.
We create an instance of `TestUptimeClient`
and wrap it in an `UptimeService`.
This effectively binds `F` to `Id`,
allowing the rest of the code to operate
synchronously without worrying about monads or applicatives:

```scala mdoc:invisible:reset-object
import cats.{Id, Applicative}
import cats.instances.list.*  // for Traverse
import cats.syntax.functor.*  // for map
import cats.syntax.traverse.* // for traverse
import scala.concurrent.Future

trait UptimeClient[F[_]]:
  def getUptime(hostname: String): F[Int]

trait RealUptimeClient extends UptimeClient[Future]

class TestUptimeClient(hosts: Map[String, Int])
    extends UptimeClient[Id]:
  def getUptime(hostname: String): Int =
    hosts.getOrElse(hostname, 0)

class UptimeService[F[_]: Applicative]
    (client: UptimeClient[F]):
  def getTotalUptime(hostnames: List[String]): F[Int] =
    hostnames.traverse(client.getUptime).map(_.sum)
```
```scala mdoc:silent
def testTotalUptime() = {
  val hosts    = Map("host1" -> 10, "host2" -> 6)
  val client   = new TestUptimeClient(hosts)
  val service  = new UptimeService(client)
  val actual   = service.getTotalUptime(hosts.keys.toList)
  val expected = hosts.values.sum
  assert(actual == expected)
}

testTotalUptime()
```

## Summary

This case study provides an example of how Cats can help us
abstract over different computational scenarios.
We used the `Applicative` type class
to abstract over asynchronous and synchronous code.
Leaning on a functional abstraction allows us
to specify the sequence of computations we want to perform
without worrying about the details of the implementation.

Back in Figure [@fig:applicatives:hierarchy],
we showed a "stack" of computational type classes
that are meant for exactly this kind of abstraction.
Type classes like `Functor`, `Applicative`, `Monad`,
and `Traverse` provide abstract implementations
of patterns such as mapping, zipping, sequencing, and iteration.
The mathematical laws on those types ensure
that they work together with a consistent set of semantics.

We used `Applicative` in this case study because
it was the least powerful type class that did what we needed.
If we had required `flatMap`,
we could have swapped out `Applicative` for `Monad`.
If we had needed to abstract over different sequence types,
we could have used `Traverse`.
There are also type classes like `ApplicativeError`
and `MonadError` that help model failures
as well as successful computations.

Let's move on now to a more complex case study
where type classes will help us produce something more interesting:
a map-reduce-style framework for parallel processing.
