## Aside: Partial Unification {#sec:functors:partial-unification}

In Section [@sec:functors:more-examples]
we saw a functor instance for `Function1`.

```scala mdoc:silent
import cats.Functor
import cats.instances.function.* // for Functor
import cats.syntax.functor.*     // for map

val func1 = (x: Int)    => x.toDouble
val func2 = (y: Double) => y * 2
```
```scala mdoc
val func3 = func1.map(func2)
```

`Function1` has two type parameters
(the function argument and the result type):

```scala
trait Function1[-A, +B] {
  def apply(arg: A): B
}
```

However, `Functor` accepts a type constructor with one parameter:

```scala
trait Functor[F[_]] {
  def map[A, B](fa: F[A])(func: A => B): F[B]
}
```

The compiler has to fix one of the two parameters
of `Function1` to create a type constructor
of the correct kind to pass to `Functor`.
It has two options to choose from:

```scala
type F[A] = Int => A
type F[A] = A => Double
```

*We* know that the former of these is the correct choice.
However the compiler doesn't understand what the code means.
Instead it relies on a simple rule, 
implementing what is called "partial unification".

The partial unification in the Scala compiler
works by fixing type parameters from left to right.
In the above example, the compiler fixes
the `Int` in `Int => Double`
and looks for a `Functor` for functions of type `Int => ?`:

```scala mdoc:silent
type F[A] = Int => A

val functor = Functor[F]
```

This left-to-right elimination works for
a wide variety of common scenarios,
including `Functors` for
types such as `Function1` and `Either`:

```scala mdoc
val either: Either[String, Int] = Right(123)

either.map(_ + 1)
```


<div class="callout callout-warning">
Partial unification is the default behaviour in Scala 2.13.
In earlier versions of Scala
we need to add the `-Ypartial-unification` compiler flag.
In sbt we would add the compiler flag in `build.sbt`:

```scala
scalacOptions += "-Ypartial-unification"
```

The rationale behind this change is discussed in [SI-2712][link-si2712].

### Limitations of Partial Unification

There are situations where
left-to-right elimination is not the correct choice.
One example is the `Or` type in [Scalactic][link-scalactic],
which is a conventionally left-biased equivalent of `Either`:

```scala
type PossibleResult = ActualResult Or Error
```

Another example is the `Contravariant` functor for `Function1`.

While the covariant `Functor` for `Function1` implements
`andThen`-style left-to-right function composition,
the `Contravariant` functor implements `compose`-style
right-to-left composition.
In other words, the following expressions are all equivalent:

```scala mdoc:silent
val func3a: Int => Double =
  a => func2(func1(a))

val func3b: Int => Double =
  func2.compose(func1)
```

```scala mdoc:fail:silent
// Hypothetical example. This won't actually compile:
val func3c: Int => Double =
  func2.contramap(func1)
```

If we try this for real, however,
our code won't compile:

```scala mdoc:silent
import cats.syntax.contravariant.* // for contramap
```

```scala mdoc:fail
val func3c = func2.contramap(func1)
```

The problem here is that the `Contravariant` for `Function1`
fixes the return type and leaves the parameter type varying,
requiring the compiler to eliminate type parameters
from right to left, as shown below and in Figure [@fig:functors:function-contramap-type-chart]:

```scala
type F[A] = A => Double
```

![Type chart: contramapping over a Function1](src/pages/functors/function-contramap.pdf+svg){#fig:functors:function-contramap-type-chart}

The compiler fails simply because of its left-to-right bias.
We can prove this by creating a type alias
that flips the parameters on Function1:

```scala mdoc:silent
type <=[B, A] = A => B
```
``` scala
type F[A] = Double <= A
```

If we re-type `func2` as an instance of `<=`,
we reset the required order of elimination and
we can call `contramap` as desired:

```scala mdoc:silent
val func2b: Double <= Double = func2
```

```scala mdoc
val func3c = func2b.contramap(func1)
```

The difference between `func2` and `func2b` is
purely syntactic---both refer to the same value
and the type aliases are otherwise completely compatible.
Incredibly, however,
this simple rephrasing is enough to
give the compiler the hint it needs
to solve the problem.

It is rare that we have to do
this kind of right-to-left elimination.
Most multi-parameter type constructors
are designed to be right-biased,
requiring the left-to-right elimination
that is supported by the compiler
out of the box.
However, it is useful to know about
this quirk of elimination order
in case you ever come across
an odd scenario like the one above.
