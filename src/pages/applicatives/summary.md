## Summary

While monads and functors are the most widely used types we've covered in this book,
cartesians and applicatives are the most general.
These type classes provide a generic mechanism
to combine values and apply functions within a context,
from which we can fashion monads and a variety of other combinators.

Cartesians and applicatives are most commonly used as
a means of combining independent values such as the results of validation rules.
Cats provides the `Validated` type for this specific purpose,
along with cartesian builder syntax as a convenient way to express the combination of rules.

We have almost covered all of the functional programming concepts on our agenda for this book.
The next chapter covers `Traverse` and `Foldable`,
two powerful type classes for converting between data types.
After that we'll look at several case studies that bring together all of the concepts covered.
