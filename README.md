## Overview

[Scala with Cats][scala-with-cats] teaches
core functional abstractions of monoids, functors, monads, and applicative functors
using the [Cats](http://typelevel.org/cats) library and a number of case studies.

## Building

The build requires a lot of heavy machinery:
texlive, node, java, scala, and pandoc and pandoc-crossref.
The simplest way to build it is to use [Docker Compose](http://docker.com)
with the provided shell scripts, `Dockerfile`, and `docker-compose.yaml`:

- install Docker Compose (`brew install docker-compose` on OS X;
  or download from [docker.com](http://docker.com/)); and

- run `go.sh` (or `docker-compose run book bash` if `go.sh` doesn't work).

This will open a `bash` shell running inside the Docker container
that contains all the dependencies to build the book.

From the shell run `sbt` to open an SBT prompt,
from which you can issue the following commands:

- `pdf` builds a PDF version in `dist/scala-with-cats.pdf`;
- `html` builds an HTML version in `dist/scala-with-cats.html`;
- `epub` builds an ePub version in `dist/scala-with-cats.epub`;
- `all` builds all three versions.

The `pdf`, `html`, and `epub` commands are each made of three smaller commands:

- `{foo}Setup` creates temp directories and builds JS/CSS prerequisites for the HTML/ePub versions;
- `mdoc` runs the files in `src/pages` through [mdoc](https://scalameta.org/mdoc/) to compile and run the Scala snippets;
- `{foo}Pandoc` runs the output of `mdoc` through [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) to produce the output.

There are also `tex` and `json` commands
(and commands like `texSetup`, `jsonPandoc`, and so on)
that build a LaTeX version of the book and a Pandoc AST respectively.
These are useful for debugging the build.
