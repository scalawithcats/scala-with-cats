## Overview

[Scala with Cats][scala-with-cats] teaches
core functional abstractions of monoids, functors, monads, and applicative functors
using the [Cats](http://typelevel.org/cats) library and a number of case studies.

## Building

Scala with Cats uses [Underscore's ebook build system][ebook-template].

The simplest way to build the book is to use [Docker Compose](http://docker.com):

- install Docker Compose (`brew install docker-compose` on OS X;
  or download from [docker.com](http://docker.com/)); and

- run `go.sh` (or `docker-compose run book bash` if `go.sh` doesn't work).

This will open a `bash` shell running inside the Docker container
that contains all the dependencies to build the book.
From the shell run:

- `npm install`; and then
- `sbt`.

Within `sbt` you can issue the commands
`pdf`, `html`, `epub`, or `all`
to build the desired version(s) of the book.
Targets are placed in the `dist` directory.
